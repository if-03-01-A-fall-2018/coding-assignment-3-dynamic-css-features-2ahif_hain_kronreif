        <h1>The First Telephone</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The concept of the telephone dates back to the string telephone or lover's telephone that has
            been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a taut string or wire. Sound waves are
            carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic
            example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of
            two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect
            noice sounds from the air, as in the ear, and a string or wire can transmit such collected voice sounds for reproduction at a distance.<br><br>

            One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and
            Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of Göttingen,
            in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices.
            Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.<br><br></p>

          <h2>important developers</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>Charles Grafton Page</dt>
              <dd>In 1840, American Charles Grafton Page passed an electric current through a coil of wire placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet.
                He observed that connecting and disconnecting the current caused a ringing sound in the magnet. He called this effect "galvanic music".</dd>

            <dt>Innocenzo Manzetti</dt>
              <dd>Innocenzo Manzetti considered the idea of a telephone as early as 1844, and may have made one in 1864, as an enhancement to an automaton built by him in 1849.</dd>

            <dt>Charles Bourseul</dt>
              <dd>Charles Bourseul was a French telegraph engineer who proposed (but did not build) the first design of a "make-and-break" telephone in 1854.
                That is about the same time that Meucci later claimed to have created his first attempt at the telephone in Italy.</dd>

            <dt>Johann Philipp Reis</dt>
              <dd>
                The Reis telephone was developed from 1857 on. Allegedly, the transmitter was difficult to operate, since the relative position
                of the needle and the contact were critical to the device's operation. Thus, it can be called a "telephone", since it did transmit
                voice sounds electrically over distance, but was hardly a commercially practical telephone in the modern sense.</dd>

            <dt>Antonio Meucci</dt>
              <dd>An early voice communicating device was invented around 1854 by Antonio Meucci, who called it a telettrofono.
                In 1871 Meucci filed a caveat at the US Patent Office. His caveat describes his invention,
                but does not mention a diaphragm, electromagnet, conversion of sound into electrical waves, conversion of electrical
                waves into sound, or other essential features of an electromagnetic telephone.</dd>

            <h2>Water microphone</h2>
            <p>Elisha Gray recognized the lack of fidelity of the make-break transmitter of Reis and Bourseul and reasoned by
              analogy with the lover's telegraph, that if the current could be made to more closely model the movements of the
              diaphragm, rather than simply opening and closing the circuit, greater fidelity might be achieved.<br><br>
              Gray filed a patent caveat with the US patent office on February 14, 1876, for a liquid microphone.
              The device used a metal needle or rod that was placed – just barely – into a liquid conductor, such as a water/acid mixture.
              In response to the diaphragm's vibrations, the needle dipped more or less into the liquid, varying the electrical resistance
              and thus the current passing through the device and on to the receiver. Gray did not convert his caveat into a patent application
              until after the caveat had expired and hence left the field open to Bell.<br><br></p>
