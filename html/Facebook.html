        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Zuckerberg wrote a program called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University
          as a sophomore (second-year student). According to The Harvard Crimson, the site was comparable
          to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two
          next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person". Facemash attracted
          450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online. The Facemash site was quickly
          forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard
          administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of
          security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.
          Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an
          art history final exam. He uploaded all art images to a website, each of which was featured with a
          corresponding comments section, then shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.
