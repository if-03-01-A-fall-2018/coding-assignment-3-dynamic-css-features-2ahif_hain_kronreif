          The first public beta version was released on 29 August 2003. In June 2005, Skype entered into
          an agreement with the Polish web portal Onet.pl for an integrated offering on the Polish market.
          On 12 September 2005, eBay Inc. agreed to acquire Luxembourg-based Skype Technologies SA for approximately
          US$2.5 billion in up-front cash and eBay stock, plus potential performance-based consideration.
