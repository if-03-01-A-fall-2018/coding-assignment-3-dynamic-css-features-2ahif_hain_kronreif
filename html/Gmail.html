          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public.
            The project was known by the code name Caribou. During early development, the project was kept
            secret from most of Google's own engineers. This changed once the project became better and better,
            and by early 2004, almost everybody was using it to access the company's internal email system.
            Gmail was announced to the public by Google on April 1, 2004 as a limited beta release.
            In November 2006, Google began offering a Java-based application of Gmail for mobile phones.
            In October 2007, Google began a process of rewriting parts of the code that Gmail used, which would
            make the service faster and add new features, such as custom keyboard shortcuts and the ability to
            bookmark specific messages and email searches. Gmail also added IMAP support in October 2007.
            An update around January 2008 changed elements of Gmail's use of JavaScript, and resulted in the
            failure of a third-party script some users had been using. Google acknowledge the issue and helped
            users with workarounds.In June 2012, Google announced that Gmail had 425 million active users globally.
            In May 2015, Google announced that Gmail had 900 million active users, 75% of whom were using the
            service on mobile devices. In February 2016, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1 billion
            active users. In July 2017, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1.2 billion active users.
