        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, both former employees of Yahoo!.
          After Koum and Acton left Yahoo! in September 2007, the duo traveled to South America to take
          a break from work. At one point, they applied for jobs at Facebook but were rejected.
          For the rest of the following years Koum relied on his $400,000 savings from Yahoo!.
          In January 2009, after purchasing an iPhone and realizing the potential of the app industry
          on the App Store, Koum started visiting his friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose where the three
          would discuss "... having statuses next to individual names of the people", but this was not
          possible without an iPhone developer. Fishman found a Russian developer on RentACoder.com,
          gor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum. Koum named the app "WhatsApp" to sound like "what's up".
          On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, because early versions of
          WhatsApp often crashed or got stuck at a particular point, Koum felt like giving up and
          looking for a new job, upon which Acton encouraged him to wait for a "few more months".

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        WhatsApp Messenger is a freeware and cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) service
        owned by Facebook. The application allows the sending of text messages and voice calls, as well
        as video calls, images and other media, documents, and user location. The application runs
        from a mobile device but is also accessible from desktop computers; the service requires[48] consumer
        users to provide a standard cellular mobile number. Originally, users could only communicate with
        others individually or in groups of individual users, but in September 2017, WhatsApp announced a
        forthcoming business platform that will enable companies to provide customer service to users at scale.
