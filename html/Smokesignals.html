      <h2>Histoy and usage</h2>

      <p>In ancient China, soldiers stationed along the Great Wall would alert each other of impending enemy attack by
        signaling from tower to tower. In this way, they were able to transmit a message as far away as 750 kilometres in just a few hours.
        Misuse of the smoke signal is known to have contributed to the fall of the Western Zhou Dynasty in the 8th century BCE.<br><br>

        King You of Zhou had a habit of fooling his warlords with false warning beacons in order to amuse Bao Si, his concubine who was
        known as one of four ancient beauties of China. When an actual rebellion occurred, no one came to the aid of the king.
        Polybius, a Greek historian, devised a more complex system of alphabetical smoke signals around 150 BCE, which converted Greek
        alphabetic characters into numeric characters. It enabled messages to be easily signaled by holding sets of torches in pairs.<br><br>

        This idea, known as the "Polybius square", also lends itself to cryptography and steganography. This cryptographic concept has been
        used with Japanese Hiragana and the Germans in the later years of the First World War.
        Smoke signals remain in use today. In Rome, the College of Cardinals uses smoke signals to indicate the selection of a new Pope during a papal conclave.
        Colored smoke grenades are commonly used by military forces to mark positions, especially during calls for artillery or air support.<br><br></p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt>Native Americans</dt>
          <dd>Lewis and Clark's journals cite several occasions when they used the Native American method of setting the plains
            on fire to communicate the presence of their party or their desire to meet with local tribes.</dd>

          <dt>Yámana</dt>
          <dd>Yámanas of South America used fire to send messages by smoke signals. The large
            amount of meat required notification of many people, so that it would not decay.</dd>

            <dt>Noon Gun</dt>
            <dd>The Cape Town Noon Gun, specifically the smoke its firing generates, was used to set marine chronometers in Table Bay.</dd>

            <dt>Aboriginal Australians</dt>
            <dd>Aboriginal Australians throughout Australia would send up smoke signals for various purposes.
               Sometimes to notify others of their presence, particularly when entering lands which were not their own.
               "Putting up a smoke" would often result in nearby individuals or groups replying with their own signals.</dd>
